# AirQuality

To Do:
Create variable for sensor readings that other processes can use (withough having to refer to scd.temperature etc)
Add current outdoor temperature to readings (to correlate furnace use with CO2).  Alternatively, find a way to measure if the furnace fan is running.
Create functions for LED display etc
Look into creating parallel processes for reading, sending data etc.
